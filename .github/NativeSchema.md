Custom Actionstep Workflow Design

No two law firms run the same way. Your workflows shouldn’t be generic.

We design bespoke Actionstep workflows aligned to your firm’s structure, work types, and compliance requirements, including:

Matter opening & intake workflows
Authorities, investigations & evidence stages
Automated task creation & deadlines
Role-based task allocation (lawyers, paralegals, admin)
Document generation and template logic
Billing, trust, and settlement workflows
Compliance checkpoints and audit controls
The result is consistent file progression, fewer errors, and less reliance on tribal knowledge.

Actionstep Automation That Reduces Admin

We remove repetitive manual work by automating:

Task creation and sequencing
Due dates triggered by key events
Document and correspondence generation
Status updates and matter progression
Internal notifications and reminders
Your team spends less time managing the system — and more time working on files.

Intake, CRM & Workflow Alignment

We specialise in end-to-end workflow design, ensuring a clean handoff from:

Enquiry → intake → matter creation
Marketing and CRM systems into Actionstep
Intake teams to legal teams
Admin to billing and settlement
This ensures nothing falls through the cracks and management has confidence in the data.

Actionstep System Cleanup & Optimisation

Already live in Actionstep but not getting the results you expected?

We regularly help firms who are dealing with:

Over-engineered or broken workflows
Duplicate, unused, or confusing fields
Task overload and alert fatigue
Inconsistent matter handling across teams
Reporting issues caused by poor workflow design
We simplify and re-engineer Actionstep setups so the system works for your firm — not against it.

Workflow-Driven Reporting Confidence

Well-designed workflows create reliable data.

We ensure your Actionstep configuration supports:

Accurate matter status tracking
Reliable financial and WIP reporting
Compliance and audit readiness
Integration with external reporting tools such as Power BI
Good reporting starts with good workflow logic.
